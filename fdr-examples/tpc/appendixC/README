Of the files in this directory,

pathol.csp

is example C.1.1, illustrating the potential explosion
of the normalization process.

The rest illustrate the use of FDR2's compression
functions.  They are as follows:

philsc.csp  dining philosophers with compression (+)(*)
scheduler.csp  Milner's scheduler (+)(*)
modcomp.csp modular compression (+)(*)
swpc.csp    sliding window protocol (*)
comppuz.csp applying compression to a puzzle

Here (*) denotes a file that uses the high level compression functions
defined in the file compression.csp, and (+) one that is dealt with
in Appendix C.

Other examples of the use of compression (some of them very simple
indeed, and some, especially in the deadlock chapter, remarkably effective) 
can be found in the following files:

chapter05/section5-1.csp
chapter12/abp-ft.csp
chapter13/madpostman.csp (*)
chapter13/teleph.csp     (*)
chapter13/matmul.csp     (*)
chapter13/ring.csp       (*)
chapter13/subtrack.csp   (*)
chapter14/crossing.csp
chapter14/tabp.csp
chapter15/ddb.csp        (*)

Try to get a feel from some of these files about what sort of systems are
likely to compress well, and READ APPENDIX C (part 2) before you try
it yourself!


The READ.ME file in chapter13 contains some useful discussion of the
application of compression strategies for deadlock checking.
