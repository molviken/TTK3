At the time of writing there is no direct implementation of the 
implementation of Timed CSP available.  Therefore the example in
this directory illustrates some of the tactics for translating
restricted forms of Timed CSP to tock-CSP that are discussed in the
Chapter.  For a simpler example, note that TCOPY2 is exactly
time(COPY).

The main obstacle to doing this comprehensively is the external choice
operator [], as discussed in the book.
