priorityfiles.csp

This directory of files illustrate the priority function implemented
for the first time in FDR 2.94

simplepri.csp introduces the functionality.

warnsorffpri.csp gives a direct implementation of Warnsdorff's algorithm
for finding knight's tours, as opposed to the indirect calculation
of priority described for this example in Chapter 20 of UCS.

PrioritySpec.csp implements the main example from the paper describing the
use of priority for checking fairness properties.

Priority is used in all Timed CSP files (see other directories) to
achieve maximal progress.

In the method implemented in the Timed CSP examples in tnifiles, it is
additionally used for creating a special specification.
