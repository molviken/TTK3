The files in this directory structure implement the great majority of the
non-trivial CSP examples from the text, plus various other related ones.
(The additional ones are likely to be extended over time.)

I hope they will help you to understand the points that the examples
are illustrating as well as see the sorts of things CSP tools can
achieve.

Please bear in mind that some of the FDR runs generated by checks
included in files associated with later chapters can be significant
in size (i.e., consumption of time and memory), and that a number of
the files contain infinite-state processes which cannot be run on
FDR.

Please look through the files and the associated sections of the book
before and as you run them.

Please let me know if you find any problems with the files and the
suggested runs/checks in them (beyond, of course, those that the files
anticipate).  Please also let me know if any further classes of example
would be useful.

Finally, I am always interested to hear how FDR compares with other
tools in terms both of ease of expression of problems and, of course,
performance.  If you have any interesting comparisons with the
more significant examples in these directories to report, please
let me know.  I would like to establish a set of benchmark problems
that allow fair and interesting comparisons of model-checking tools.
Again, let me know if you have any suggestions for these.
