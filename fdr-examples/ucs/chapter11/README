Of the models described in Chapter 11, only the stable revivals model and
the refusal testing models are implemented in FDR at the time of writing.
Furthermore only a rather limited prioritisation mode (designed for traces
checks of timed systems) is in place.

Therefore the files in this directory are limited to revivals and to
basic refusal testing.

The latter indicates how one can create prioritised checks without
running in a prioritised model by introducing "don't care" conditions
into specifications in cases where priority rules have been violated.
