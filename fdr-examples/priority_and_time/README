This directory has three subdirectories that illustrate some of the
new functionality of FDR 2.94, specifically

priority  priorityfiles
Timed CSP tcspfiles

and a specific application of both of these things to determining
timed noninterference: tnifiles

Another new feature of FDR 2.94, namely the divergence-respecting weak
bisimulation compression wbisim, appears in a number of these files, as
no other compression apart from strong bisimulation may be used inside the
priority operator (and consequently in Timed CSP files.)
