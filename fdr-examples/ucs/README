ucsexamples

This directory contains CSP files implementing most of the examples
from Understanding Concurrent Systems, by Bill Roscoe, as at the book's
publication in October 2010.

They are organised by book chapter.  Note that the file compression09.csp
of compression utilities appears in several of the chapter subdirectories,
since it is included in several files.

The primary tool they are designed for is FDR.

In a few cases, for example relating to the translation of Timed CSP in
Chapter 15 and some of the syntax for priority discussed in Chapters 14 and 20
not all desired functionality is present in FDR at the time of writing, so
there are no corresponding files in this release.

The CSP example files for Chapters 18 and 19 are constituents of the SVA
compiler and can be found in the separate download of SVA.

Please let Bill Roscoe know if you find any errors in these files.
