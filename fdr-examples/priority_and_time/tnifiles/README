This directory contains examples that illustrate the methods of
checking timed noninterference described in "Checking noninterference
in Timed CSP"

The code that does the checking is common to them all and as
described in the paper.  This is rather complex compared to most CSP/FDR
specifications.

The examples are based on multiplexing high and low-level channels,
and on a simple cloud computing model.  Apart from the last, these are
closely related to the case studies in the paper referred to above.
