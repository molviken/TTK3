This directory contains files illustrating the use of the
Timed CSP functionality of FDR.  They are the examples
mentioned in the paper "Model Checking Timed CSP",
together with a simpletimed.csp, which simply
illustrates the notation and usage, and tfr.csp, which
implements Timed Failures refinement in terms of
refusal testing.

More examples of Timed CSP can be found in the directory
tnifiles.

They all require at least FDR 2.94, the first release to incorporate
Timed CSP.
